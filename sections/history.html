    <h1>HISTORY</h1>

    <main>
        <div>
            <p>Patricia Lee Smith (born December 30, 1946) is an American singer, songwriter, poet, painter, and author
                who became an influential component of the New York City punk rock movement with her 1975 debut album
                Horses.</p>

            <p>Called the "punk poet laureate", Smith fused rock and poetry in her work. Her most widely known song,
                "Because the Night", co-written with Bruce Springsteen, reached number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart
                in 1978 and number five on UK charts. In 2005, Smith was named a Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des
                Lettres by the French Ministry of Culture. In 2007, she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of
                Fame.</p>

            <p>In November 2010, Smith won the National Book Award for her memoir Just Kids. The book fulfilled a
                promise she made to her former long-time partner Robert Mapplethorpe. She is ranked 47th on Rolling
                Stone magazine's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, which was published in 2010 and was also a recipient
                of the 2011 Polar Music Prize.</p>
