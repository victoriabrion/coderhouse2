                <p>Horses is the debut studio album by American musician Patti Smith. It was released on November 10,
                    1975 by Arista Records. A fixture of the mid-1970s underground rock music scene in New York City,
                    Smith signed to Arista in 1975 and recorded Horses with her band at Electric Lady Studios in August
                    and September of that year. She enlisted former Velvet Underground member John Cale to produce the
                    album.</p>

            <div class="radioEthiopia">
                <p>Radio Ethiopia was the follow-up record to Smith's widely acclaimed debut Horses. In interviews
                    surrounding the album's release, Smith explained that she chose producer Jack Douglas in hopes of
                    making the album commercially successful. Smith co-wrote much of the album with bassist Ivan Kr√°l,
                    the band member keenest for commercial success.</p>

            <div class="easter">
                <p>Easter is the third studio album by the Patti Smith Group. It was released in March 1978 by Arista
                    Records. Produced by Jimmy Iovine, the album is regarded as the group's commercial breakthrough,
                    owing to the success of the rock single "Because the Night" (co-written by Bruce Springsteen and
                    Smith), which reached number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number five on the UK Singles Chart.

                <p>Wave is the fourth and final studio album by the Patti Smith Group. It was released on May 17, 1979,
                    by Arista Records. Produced by Todd Rundgren, the album continued the band's move towards more
                    radio-friendly mainstream pop rock sound.</p>
